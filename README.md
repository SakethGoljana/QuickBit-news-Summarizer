# QuickBit: News Article Summarizer 📄✨

**QuickBit** is a lightweight, user-friendly tool that summarizes news articles in a snap! 🚀 It uses **extractive** (NLTK) and **abstractive** (BART) summarization to deliver concise insights from URLs or text input. Built for Google Colab, it’s perfect for anyone who wants to grasp the gist of news articles without reading the full text. 📰

## 🛠️ Setup

Get **QuickBit** up and running in Google Colab in just a few steps! 🧑‍💻

### Prerequisites
- A Google account to access [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
- An internet connection for package downloads. 🌐

### Installation
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) and create a new notebook.
2. Copy and paste the code from the `QuickBit_News_Summarizer_Simple.py` file (provided separately) into a code cell.
3. Run the cell to install dependencies and execute the script. The following packages are installed:
   ```bash
   !pip install transformers==4.51.3 torch==2.6.0 newspaper3k==0.2.8 nltk==3.9.1 lxml_html_clean==0.3.1
   ```
   These ensure compatibility and resolve issues like `lxml` and `punkt_tab` errors.

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Run the Script**:
   - Execute the code in your Colab notebook.
   - The script will prompt: `QuickBit: News Summarizer`.

2. **Choose Input**:
   - Enter `1` for a news article URL (e.g., `https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67068390`).
   - Enter `2` to paste article text directly.

3. **View Summaries**:
   - **Extractive Summary**: Key sentences selected based on word frequency.
   - **Abstractive Summary**: A concise, rewritten summary generated by BART.

### Example
**Input** (Text):
```
The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming industries worldwide. From healthcare to finance, AI systems are being deployed to improve efficiency, accuracy, and decision-making...
```

**Output**:
```
QuickBit: News Summarizer
Enter 1 for URL or 2 for text: 2
Paste article text: [pasted text]

Extractive Summary:
The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming industries worldwide. In healthcare, AI is used to diagnose diseases from medical images with accuracy comparable to human experts. Experts believe that while AI offers immense potential, addressing its ethical challenges is crucial for sustainable growth.

Abstractive Summary:
Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing healthcare and finance by enhancing efficiency and decision-making. It diagnoses diseases and predicts market trends, but ethical concerns like bias and job displacement are driving efforts to create regulations for responsible AI development.

## 🔧 Customization

Tweak **QuickBit** to suit your needs! 🛠️
- **Extractive Summary Length**:
  - Modify `num_sentences=3` in the `extractive_summary` function to include more or fewer sentences.
- **Abstractive Summary Length**:
  - Adjust `max_length=150` or `min_length=40` in the `abstractive_summary` function for longer or shorter summaries.
- **Input Handling**:
  - Extend the `quick_bit` function to support multi-line text input or file uploads (see future improvements).

---

## 📋 Requirements

- **Python**: 3.11 (Colab default).
- **Dependencies**:
  - `transformers==4.51.3`: For BART model.
  - `torch==2.6.0`: PyTorch for model inference.
  - `newspaper3k==0.2.8`: For URL parsing.
  - `nltk==3.9.1`: For extractive summarization.
  - `lxml_html_clean==0.3.1`: To resolve `lxml` import issues.

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

- **NLTK `punkt_tab` Error**:
  - Ensure `nltk.download('punkt_tab')` runs successfully.
  - Check: `!ls /root/nltk_data/tokenizers`.
- **URL Fetching Issues**:
  - Use valid news article URLs (e.g., BBC, CNN).
  - Verify the URL has accessible text content.
- **Memory Issues**:
  - BART is resource-heavy. If it crashes, reduce `max_length` in `abstractive_summary` or use Colab Pro.
- **Installation Errors**:
  - Restart the runtime (**Runtime > Restart runtime**) and rerun.
  - Verify package versions match those specified.

---

## 🌱 Future Improvements

- 📂 Save summaries to a file (e.g., TXT or CSV).
- 🔄 Support multi-line text input with a clear delimiter.
- 📊 Add a comparison metric for extractive vs. abstractive summaries.
- 🌐 Extend URL parsing to handle more websites.
